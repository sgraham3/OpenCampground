<h1>Explaination of mail attachments</h1>
<p>
A number of different types of file can be attached to any of the email messages defined by the system.
You can have as many attachments as you feel necessary.
The same file can be used as an attachment by multiple different email messages but each file must have a unique name.
Only a pre-defined set of file types can be used as attachments.
If you feel there are other types that should be available send an email to norm@opencampground.com
</p><p>
Attachments that the system is designed to handle are:
<ul><li>
.png, .jpg or .jpeg graphic files
</li><li>
.txt plain text files
</li><li>
.doc files generated by a word processing program
</li><li>
.pdf text/image file
</li>
</ul>
</p>
To associate an attachment with a specific message first click on "Attachments" on the message in Mail Messages.
Then on the Attachments page click on "Choose File" and navigate to the folder the file is in, select the file and click on open.
This will put the file name next to the "Choose File" box.  
Next click on "Upload attachment".  This will connect the attachment with this email message.
To no longer send that attachment just click on "delete attachment" by the attachment name.
